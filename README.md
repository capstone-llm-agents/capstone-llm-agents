## Project Description:
Intelligent agent technology is an important artificial intelligent (AI) paradigm aiming to develop AI systems that can operate successfully in a task environment to achieve beneficial outcomes. In recent years, Large Language models (LLMs) has become a significant advancement in AI technologies to achieve some important capabilities in natural language understanding and generation and problem solving. Thus, it’s natural to consider LLM as the engine to build powerful intelligent agents. On the other hand, enhancing current LLMs with the intelligent agent’s capabilities of sensing and acting can significantly extend their versatility and applicability in many important applications. This project focuses on building a prototype for multiagent systems consisting of multiple LLM-based agents who can cooperate to work on tasks that require different agents with different capabilities and knowledge bases to jointly arrive at a solution to the problem or a joint plan to achieve common goals.
